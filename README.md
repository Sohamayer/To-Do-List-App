## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Add a task:** Type a task in the input box and click **Add**.  
2. **Mark as complete:** Click the checkbox to strike through completed tasks.  
3. **Edit a task:** Click the **Edit** button to modify an existing task.  
4. **Delete a task:** Click **Delete** to remove a specific task.  
5. **Clear all tasks:** Click **Clear All** to remove everything (asks for confirmation).  
6. **Persistent data:** All tasks are stored using browser **Local Storage**, so they remain after page reload.

## 🧱 Validation & Error Handling

- Prevents adding empty tasks (`alert` message shown).  
- Asks for confirmation before clearing all tasks.  
- Ensures edited task updates only one entry.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The interface automatically adapts to screen sizes using **CSS Flexbox** and **media queries**, ensuring usability on mobile and desktop.
